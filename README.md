## Tensor Calculator

This project provides a Python class called TensorCalculator that allows you to perform various operations on PyTorch tensors, such as creating tensors filled with zeros or ones, generating random tensors, calculating the sum, difference, multiplication, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of tensors. 
It also includes example usages of the class methods.

## Class Installation

### To use the TensorCalculator class, you'll need to have PyTorch installed. You can install PyTorch using pip:

 ```sh
pip install torch
```
### After installing PyTorch, you can use the TensorCalculator class by importing it into your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

 ```sh
from tensor_calculator import TensorCalculator
```

## Class Usage

The TensorCalculator class is designed for working with PyTorch tensors. It provides several static methods for performing common tensor operations. Here's how to use it:

 ```sh
# Example: Create tensors filled with zeros
zeros_tensor = TensorCalculator.tensor_zeros(2, 3, 4)

# Example: Calculate the sum of two tensors
tensor_sum = TensorCalculator.tensor_sum(tensor1, tensor2)
```

Also, there are more examples in the code: tensor_calculator.py

## Class Methods

### The TensorCalculator class includes the following static methods:

- tensor_zeros(dim_x, dim_y, dim_z): Creates a tensor filled with zeros of the specified dimensions.
- tensor_ones(dim_x, dim_y, dim_z): Creates a tensor filled with ones of the specified dimensions.
- tensor_random(dim_x, dim_y, dim_z): Generates a random tensor of the specified dimensions.
- tensor_sum(tensor_1, tensor_2): Calculates the sum of two tensors.
- tensor_diff(tensor_1, tensor_2): Calculates the difference of two tensors.
- tensor_mult(tensor_1, tensor_2): Calculates the multiplication of two tensors.
- tensor_mean(tensor_1): Calculates the mean of a tensor.
- tensor_stdev(tensor_1): Calculates the standard deviation of a tensor.
- tensor_min(tensor_1): Finds the minimum value in a tensor.
- tensor_max(tensor_1): Finds the maximum value in a tensor.

## Examples

The project includes examples of how to use the TensorCalculator class to perform various tensor operations. You can find these examples in the code comments at the end of the provided Python script. Here are some of the examples:

- Creating tensors filled with zeros, ones, and random values.
- Calculating the sum, difference, and element-wise multiplication of tensors.
- Computing the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of tensors.

You can refer to these examples to understand how to use the class for your own tensor calculations.
